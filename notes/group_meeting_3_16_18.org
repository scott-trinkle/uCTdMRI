* Paper summary
** Abstract
*** Testing how HARDI models and reconstruction methods predict ground truth FOD
**** 5 dMRI methods
*** Evaluation criteria:
**** Agreement in FOD shape
**** Correct assessment of number of fiber populations
**** Angular accuracy in orientation
**** Fiber dispersion
*** Results
**** No method outperformed in all categories, all had tradeoffs
**** All describe FOD structure well (r > 0.70)
**** None are consisten in discrete number/orientation of FOD peaks
**** Did not strongly vary with acquisition parameters
**** Good at identifying crossing fibers with 90 degrees, less so with <60
**** Limited in ability to capture orientation dispersion
** Methods
*** MRI
**** Squirrel monkey
**** 300 um isotropic resolution
**** 100 gradient directions
**** Repeated with 4 b-values
*** Histology
**** fter MR, brain was section at 50 um
**** Digital photograph prior to each 3rd section
***** 3D "block-face" volume with through-plane resolution of 150 um
**** Slides were image with confocal microscope
***** 2D montage of entire tissue section
****** 600-900 0.80 um^2 tiles
****** for use in image registration and localizing 3D ROI
***** 3D high-resolution image of ROI
****** 0.18 um x 0.18 um x 0.42 um
****** 900 um x 900 um FOV
****** 9 MRI voxels
- "The through-plane resolution is the “optimal” slice-thickness, calculated from the LSM710 
  software based on a 1.0 Airy unit pinhole diameter and an excitation wavelength of 543 nm"
**** Process 3D ROI to remove experimental anisotropy
***** Increase laser intensity at greater depth
***** Deconvolve with RL
***** Cubic interpolation to isotropic resolution
***** Correct for shrinkage from fixation
**** STA
***** FOD from histogram of orientations
***** Fit to high order (20) SH
*** Registration
**** Register 2D montage to block face photos
***** Linear and nonlinear
**** Block face photos assembled to volume, registered to MRI b=0 image
***** Linear and nonlinear
**** Determine location of 3D ROI
***** Given its location in 2D montage
***** Use combined deformation field to locate volume in MRI
**** MRI ROI 
***** analyzed in MRI space
***** transformed to histology space
*** Orientation metrics
**** Peak finding algorithm
***** find fiber populations and orientations
***** Crossing angle for crossing fiber voxels
**** Dispersion
***** Watson distribution (spherical gaussian)
*** Evaluation criteria
**** Agreement in shape
***** angular correlation coefficient
****** from SH coeffs
***** "Jensen-Shannon" divergence
**** Assessment in number of fibers
***** success rate
****** algorithm is "success" if detects all peaks from histology, w/in angular tolerance
***** consistency fraction
****** if successful AND number of peaks matches
***** Looked at FP and FN
**** angular accuracy in orientation estimation
***** error in degrees between estimated and histology FOD peaks
**** correlation in dispersion
***** linear correlation
*** Variables
**** Fiber geometry
***** single vs crossing fibers
**** metrics as a function of crossing angle
**** effects of dispersion on angular error
**** effects of number of DWIs on accuracy
**** effects of b-value
** Discussion
*** None are best at everything
*** All show overall angular structure of FOD well
**** None are great at discrete number/orientation of peaks
*** Algorithms have different physical models
**** Suggests using empirical FODs to derive new models
*** All show robustness to acquitision parameters (b-value, number of DW directions)
*** Future work
**** Effects of spatial resolution
**** Limitations of histology
"While validation comparing dMRI and histology is the only validation method 
able to capture both the enormous complexity of the white matter in addition
to the practical affects of image acquisition, it is not wihout limitations"
***** Tissue deterioration
***** 50 um tissue sections vs 300 um MRI
**** Didn't account for "bending" fibers
***** quantify curviture
* Two questions for validation: 
** How to best exploit xray data?
** How well does the diffusion MRI FOD reflect underlying microstructure?
*** dMRI data -> FODs
*** Depends on MRI acquisition parameters, HARDI/DTI algorithm 
*** Use xray ST as "microstructure" ground truth
**** Basically, replicate Schilling paper with xray
**** Create FODs from xray in a few challenging ROI, test/compare different HARDI algorithms
***** Do we have the MR data we need to test multiple HARDI algorithms?
**** But how much of an advantage is xray? Natively 3D/isotropic? Isn't it worse resolution?
**** No need for whole brain
***** Register ROI instead of whole brain - easier problem
** How well do different tractography algorithms estimate underlying tracts?
*** FODs -> tracts
*** Assuming major bottleneck is accuracy of FODs describing microstructure, but also robustness of algorithm itself
*** Use "ground truth" xray FODs from ST to test upper limit performance of different tractography algorithms
**** Compare xray ST FODs to segmented nerve tracts from xray 
**** AVOIDS registration problem
*** Issues
**** Maybe not as helpful in making MRI tractography better
***** Overfitting / won't get "ground truth" FODs from MRI
***** BUT, could be useful to see the peak performance
**** Potential solution: 
***** Can test at arbitrary scales
****** Create FODs at MRI resolution
****** Could also simulate FOD "noise" / errors from MRI
******* Use tensor model instead of HARDI, etc.
*** We COULD use the whole brain for
**** Re-introduces segmentation problem
**** We'll need to deal with xray artifacts
* Update
** Anything from Vogelstein?
** ST commissure visualization
** Tried to compare MRI tensor data to ST results from b0 MRI
*** Meaningless result, meaningless comparison
**** MRI tensor is based on true microstructure, not reflected in b0 resolution
** Can I get full-sized xray ROI?
*** To develop FOD calculations
*** ST is sensitive to sigma values
*** Size of MRI voxel or smaller
*** In relatively interesting ROI
* Notes
** Looking at orthogonal theory
** ISMRM in montreal
** F31 - look at deadline
