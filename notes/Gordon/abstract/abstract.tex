\maketitle

Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a powerful, non-invasive tool for characterizing
three-dimensional (3D) tissue microstructure on a macroscopic scale, and is
widely used in both research and clinical settings. New methods of
reconstructing 3D fiber orientation distributions (FODs) from dMRI data are
rapidly being developed, each based on the assumption that the diffusion
contrast from dMRI provides an accurate representation of the underlying
anatomical fiber structure. Previous efforts to validate these FODs have relied
on ground truth histological data with non-isotropic resolution over small
regions of interest (ROI). In this study, we demonstrate a pipeline for the use
of natively isotropic, synchrotron-based x-ray microcomputed tomography data to
validate FODs over a whole mouse brain.

A post-mortem brain was scanned on a Bruker 9.4 T magnet with a 3D
diffusion-weighted spin-echo sequence at 150 $\mu\text{m}$ isotropic
resolution. Data was acquired at a b-value of 3000 s/mm$^2$ over 60 uniformly
distributed directions. The specimen was then stained with uranyl acetate,
osmium tetroxide and lead citrate in preparation for x-ray imaging at the
Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Lab. The x-ray data was acquired
using a mosaic stitching method, yielding an image volume over the whole brain
with 1.2 $\mu$m isotropic resolution. N (number TBD) sample ROIs were identified
for validation based on anatomical locations with crossing fiber populations
that are known to challenge dMRI algorithms. Structure tensor analysis was
performed on the x-ray data to compute a ground truth FOD at each ROI. The
corresponding FODs were reconstructed from the dMRI data using two high angular
resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) methods: constrained spherical
deconvolution and Q-ball imaging. FODs from both HARDI methods were compared to the
ground truth x-ray FODS and evaluated based on overall agreement in shape,
correct assessment of the number of fiber populations, and angular accuracy in
orientation.

(Quantitative results TBD)

This study has demonstrated the feasibility of performing quantitative 3D
validation of dMRI FODs with synchrotron x-ray data. This marks the first
available ground truth dataset and methodology to allow for whole-brain
validation of dMRI FODs with natively isotropic resolution and no sectioning. The
application of this analysis to a whole mouse brain will provide a wealth of
information regarding the ability of different dMRI algorithms to represent
microstructural regions of varying complexity, and will provide the means to
perform future large-scale validation studies in dMRI, tractography, and
connectomics.
