\maketitle

Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a powerful, non-invasive tool for characterizing
three-dimensional (3D) tissue microstructure on a macroscopic scale, and is
widely used in both research and clinical settings. New methods of
reconstructing 3D fiber orientation distributions (FODs) from dMRI data are
rapidly being developed, each based on the assumption that dMRI provides an
accurate model of the underlying anatomical fiber structure. Previous efforts to
validate this assumption have relied on ground truth histological data with
non-isotropic resolution over a small field of view. In this study, we
develop a pipeline for the use of natively isotropic, synchrotron-based x-ray microcomputed
tomography ($\mu$CT) data to validate dMRI FODs over a whole mouse brain.

A post-mortem brain was scanned with dMRI (\textit{waiting on MRI specs from
  Sean}) at 150 $\mu\text{m}^3$ resolution. The specimen was then stained
(\textit{what are the stains? Anything else on uCT preparation?}) and imaged at
the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Lab using a mosaic sinogram
stitching method, yielding an image volume over the whole brain with isotropic
1.2 $\mu\text{m}^3$ resolution. N (\textit{actual number TBD}) sample ROI were
identified for validation based on prior anatomical knowledge. Structure tensor
analysis was performed on the x-ray data to compute a ground truth FOD for each
ROI. The corresponding FODs from the dMRI data were evaluated based on overall
agreement in FOD shape, correct assessment of the number of fiber populations,
and angular accuracy in orientation (\textit{criteria taken verbatim from
  Schilling}).

(\textit{Expecting comparable results to Schilling, actual results TBD}) 

This study has led to the development of a pipeline for performing quantitative
3D validation of dMRI FODs over a whole mouse brain with isotropic resolution.
Ground truth FODs across the whole brain will allow for further validation studies
in dMRI and tractography. 


% Schilling
% MRI
% - 300 um^3 isotropic resolution
% 3D histology
% - 0.18x0.18x0.42 um^3 resolution
% - In plane FOV of 900 x 900 um (9 MRI voxels)
% - N > 10 regions for each histogram bin from <30-90 degrees with bin width 10
%   - So ~100 total regions, each the size of 9 MRI voxels
