abstract = {Three dimensional polarized light imaging (3D-PLI) uti- lizes the birefringence in postmortem tissue to map its spatial fiber structure at a submillimeter resolution. We propose an analytical method to compute the fiber orientation distribution function (ODF) from high-resolution vector data provided by 3D-PLI. This strategy enables the bridging of high resolution 3D-PLI to diffusion magnetic resonance imaging with rela- tively low spatial resolution. First, the fiber ODF is modeled as a sum of K orientations on the unit sphere and expanded with a high order spherical harmonics series. Then, the co- efficients of the spherical harmonics are derived directly with the spherical Fourier transform. We quantitatively validate the accuracy of the reconstruction against synthetic data and show that we can recover complex fiber configurations in the human heart at different scales. Index},

abstract = {The problem of optimal detection of orientation in arbitrary neighborhoods is solved in the least squares sense. It is shown that this corresponds to fitting an axis in the Fourier domain of the n-dimensional neighborhood, the solution of which is a solution of a matrix eigenvalue problem. The eigenvalues are the variance or inertia with respect to the axes given by their respective eigenvectors. The orientation is taken as the axis given by the least eigenvalue. It is shown that the necessary computations can be pursued in the spatial domain without a Fourier transformation. An implementation for 2-D is presented. Two certainty measures are given corresponding to the orientation estimate. These are the relative or the absolute distances between the two eigenvalues, revealing whether the fitted axis is better than an axis orthogonal to it. The result of the implementation is verified by experiments which confirm an accurate orientation estimation and a reliable certainty measure in the presence of additive noise at high levels as well as low levels.},

abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is widely used to probe tissue microstructure, and is currently the only non-invasive way to measure the brain's fiber architecture. While a large number of approaches to recover the intra-voxel fiber structure have been utilized in the scientific community, a direct, 3D, quantitative validation of these methods against relevant histological fiber geometries is lacking. In this study, we investigate how well different high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) models and reconstruction methods predict the ground-truth histologically defined fiber orientation distribution (FOD), as well as investigate their behavior over a range of physical and experimental conditions. The dMRI methods tested include constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD), Q-ball imaging (QBI), diffusion orientation transform (DOT), persistent angular structure (PAS), and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) methods. Evaluation criteria focus on overall agreement in FOD shape, correct assessment of the number of fiber populations, and angular accuracy in orientation. In addition, we make comparisons of the histological orientation dispersion with the fiber spread determined from the dMRI methods. As a general result, no HARDI method outperformed others in all quality criteria, with many showing tradeoffs in reconstruction accuracy. All reconstruction techniques describe the overall continuous angular structure of the histological FOD quite well, with good to moderate correlation (median angular correlation coefficient {\textgreater} 0.70) in both single- and multiple-fiber voxels. However, no method is consistently successful at extracting discrete measures of the number and orientations of FOD peaks. The major inaccuracies of all techniques tend to be in extracting local maxima of the FOD, resulting in either false positive or false negative peaks. Median angular errors are ∼10° for the primary fiber direction and ∼20° for the secondary fiber, if present. For most methods, these results did not vary strongly over a wide range of acquisition parameters (number of diffusion weighting directions and b value). Regardless of acquisition parameters, all methods show improved successes at resolving multiple fiber compartments in a voxel when fiber populations cross at near-orthogonal angles, with no method adequately capturing low to moderate angle ({\textless}60°) crossing fibers. Finally, most methods are limited in their ability to capture orientation dispersion, resulting in low to moderate, yet statistically significant, correlation with histologically-derived dispersion with both HARDI and NODDI methodologies. Together, these results provide quantitative measures of the reliability and limitations of dMRI reconstruction methods and can be used to identify relative advantages of competing approaches as well as potential strategies for improving accuracy.},

@article{Vescovi2017,
abstract = {A hybrid method of stitching X-ray computed tomography (CT) datasets is proposed and the feasibility to apply the scheme in a synchrotron tomography beamline with micrometre resolution is shown. The proposed method enables the field of view of the system to be extended while spatial resolution and experimental setup remain unchanged. The approach relies on taking full tomographic datasets at different positions in a mosaic array and registering the frames using Fourier phase correlation and a residue-based correlation. To ensure correlation correctness, the limits for the shifts are determined from the experimental motor position readouts. The masked correlation image is then minimized to obtain the correct shift. The partial datasets are blended in the sinogram space to be compatible with common CT reconstructors. The feasibility to use the algorithm to blend the partial datasets in projection space is also shown, creating a new single dataset, and standard reconstruction algorithms are used to restore high-resolution slices even with a small number of projections.},
